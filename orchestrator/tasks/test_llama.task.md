# Task: Test LLAMA Integration with Real AI

**Target Files:**
- ./src/orchestrator.py
- ./config/settings.py

**Prompt:**
Please analyze the AI Task Orchestrator codebase and provide insights on:
1. Architecture quality and design patterns
2. Potential improvements for scalability
3. Code organization and maintainability
4. Integration points that could be enhanced

Focus on the orchestrator pattern and configuration management.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Comprehensive code analysis completed
- [ ] Architecture strengths identified
- [ ] Improvement recommendations provided
- [ ] Integration patterns evaluated

**Context:**
This is a test of the LLAMA-powered workflow with a real language model (Llama 3.2 with 128k context). We want to validate that LLAMA can intelligently parse tasks and create optimized prompts for Claude Code execution.
