# Task: Add Comprehensive Error Handling to Task Parser

**Target Files:**
- ./src/core/task_parser.py
- ./src/core/interfaces.py

**Prompt:**
Enhance the TaskParser class with comprehensive error handling and validation:

1. Add detailed error messages for common parsing failures (missing frontmatter, invalid YAML, missing required fields)
2. Add a new method `get_detailed_validation_report()` that returns structured error information
3. Add input sanitization to prevent injection attacks in task content
4. Add file size limits (max 10MB) and content validation
5. Create proper exception classes: `TaskParseError`, `TaskValidationError`, `TaskSecurityError`
6. Add logging for all error conditions
7. Update the interfaces to include the new exception classes and validation methods

The goal is to make the parser production-ready with enterprise-grade error handling.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] New exception classes added to interfaces.py
- [ ] TaskParser enhanced with comprehensive error handling
- [ ] New get_detailed_validation_report() method implemented
- [ ] Input sanitization added for security
- [ ] File size validation implemented
- [ ] Proper logging added throughout
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and style

**Context:**
This is a critical production readiness enhancement. The current parser works but needs enterprise-grade error handling, security measures, and detailed validation reporting. This will be used in automated systems where clear error reporting is essential.

IMPORTANT: Preserve all existing functionality while adding these enhancements. The parser must remain backward compatible.
