# Progress Log

## 2025-10-21

### Completed
- Removed the Windows-specific default paths from `config/settings.py`, relying on environment overrides instead.
- Refreshed `.env.example` with cross-platform defaults and Time-Lab placeholders.
- Updated `docs/README.md` to explain environment setup and point to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for detailed platform guidance.

### Next Up
- Finish Phase 0 of `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`: validate a Linux/Nix run, capture sample artifacts, and confirm the orchestrator respects the injected paths.
- Prepare for Time-Lab Phase 1 by sketching the artifact hand-off schema that the adapter will write.
