I've successfully implemented the hybrid agent selection system you requested! Here's what has been accomplished:

  ✅ What's Been Implemented:

  1. Hybrid Architecture - Preserved your existing complex LLama infrastructure while adding manual bypass
  2. Manual Agent Selection - Your existing Telegram commands (/documentation, /code_review, /bug_fix, /analyze) now
   bypass automatic classification
  3. Natural Prompt Generation - Manual agents create prompts like "Our task today consists of [intent] for
  [agent_type]" with your general principles + specialized instructions
  4. Backward Compatibility - /task and natural language messages still use automatic mode

  ✅ Files Modified:

  - src/orchestrator.py - Added agent_type metadata passing (lines 1017-1018, 1050)
  - src/bridges/llama_mediator.py - Added bypass logic and manual prompt generation (lines 205-483)

  ✅ Files Created:

  - AGENT_USAGE_GUIDE.md - Comprehensive usage documentation
  - PROMPT_COMPARISON.md - Shows automatic vs manual prompt differences

  🎯 How to Use It:

  Manual Mode (New):

  /documentation Create API docs for auth module
  /code_review Security audit of payment system
  /bug_fix Memory leak in background worker
  /analyze Database performance bottlenecks

  Automatic Mode (Existing):

  /task Review the authentication code
  "Help me understand this codebase"

  🔄 The Flow:

  Manual: /documentation → agent_type=documentation → bypass → specialized prompt
  Auto:   /task → no agent_type → LLama analysis → optimized prompt

  🎨 Key Benefits:

  - ✅ Preserves existing infrastructure - Your LLama system stays intact
  - ✅ Manual control when you know what you want
  - ✅ Natural prompts - "Our task today consists of..." format
  - ✅ User intent clarity - Always prominent in the final prompt
  - ✅ Minimal code changes - Just 3 small modifications
  - ✅ Easy to extend - Add new agents by updating one method

  Your system now gives you the best of both worlds - intelligent automation when exploring, and precise control
  when you know exactly what type of work needs to be done!

> and what is this optimized prompt in auto? is it the same as the agent/manual functionality with just auto
  identified intent and task instructions ? I mean we need to again use the general principles - it's valid for coding
   tasks usually. And to be stitching the same or similar structure. basically "our task is ..." and relying on it to
  draw it out, then "..we are working on user specified task - likely bulked or expanded version with minimum with the
   general instructions or potentially with specific instructions for general mode so to say

● You're absolutely right! Looking at the current automatic mode, it's using the old template-based approach instead
   of the beautiful natural flow we created for manual agents. Let me examine and fix this.

● Read(src\bridges\llama_mediator.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Exactly! I see the problem. The current automatic mode (_create_prompt_with_template) is using this ugly, rigid
  format:

  Task: ANALYZE - Task title
  Priority: MEDIUM
  Description: ...
  Agent Instructions: ...
  General Instructions: ...

  But our beautiful manual agent format is:

  Our task today consists of [intent] for [task_type].

  Following these core principles:
  [general_principles]

  For this specific task, here are the specialized instructions:
  [agent_instructions]

  Let's begin: [intent]

  Let me unify both to use the same natural, conversational structure!

● Update(src\bridges\llama_mediator.py)
  ⎿  Updated src\bridges\llama_mediator.py with 37 additions and 64 removals
       

● Perfect! Now let me also update the LLAMA-generated prompts to use the same structure. Let me check the
  _create_prompt_with_llama method:

● Read(src\bridges\llama_mediator.py)
  ⎿  Read 35 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now I need to update the LLAMA prompt generation to also follow the unified structure. Let me modify it to
  instruct LLAMA to create prompts in our preferred format:

● Update(src\bridges\llama_mediator.py)
  ⎿  Updated src\bridges\llama_mediator.py with 40 additions and 14 removals
      

● Now let me test the unified prompt structure:

STart with the relevant test, but first review
