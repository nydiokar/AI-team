Status: I reviewed the artifact, logs, and pipeline. The task did run headless and created codex_integration.md, but our pipeline didn’t attribute the write and validation flagged low similarity.
Key issues observed
Intent/Type
Defaulting to analyze when the intent is “create/implement” biases toward non-edit behavior.
LLAMA prompt is generic when no target files are listed.
Files modified tracking
files_modified is empty even though codex_integration.md was created. Our extractor only looks for “Modified:/Edited:/Updated:/Created:” lines; Claude’s JSON “result” says “created at /ai-team/codex_integration.md” which doesn’t match our patterns.
Validation signals
LLAMA similarity/entropy checks penalize documentation-like outputs; thresholds aren’t per-task-type, so “valid: false” appears despite a successful run.
“input_tokens: 4” comes from Claude’s own usage payload and isn’t reliable for our internal telemetry.
Operational UX
Long run time (159s/296s) because max_turns=0 (unlimited). For doc/feature tasks, we likely want sane caps.
What’s already improved (just landed)
Intent parsing now classifies action verbs as fix (implement/add/create/build/write/generate/apply/refactor/enforce/replace/wire/integrate).
LLAMA mediator adds a “discover relevant files, then implement changes; do not just summarize” block when no target_files are listed.
Targeted optimizations to make this robust and self-sufficient
Better task typing (no hand-holding)
Expand verb → type mapping (done). Add doc-specific cues: “documentation”, “doc”, “write docs” to map to fix (so writes are permitted).
Optional: if description mentions a known roadmap item (e.g., “next_stage.md 5”), inject that doc path into target_files to anchor discovery.
Stronger LLAMA prompt scaffolding
Route by task type to richer templates in prompts/agents/:
fix → prompts/agents/bug_fix.md style guidance (minimal edits, tests).
documentation → prompts/agents/documentation.md (structure, location, TOC).
analyze/review → existing analyze/code_review.
When target_files is empty for fix/feature/doc: explicitly require “identify files, then edit,” and “print a short changelog including paths”.
Accurate files_modified (no false empty)
Add pre/post filesystem snapshot within allowed_root:
Before exec: map {path: mtime, size}.
After exec: diff → created/modified files; set files_modified deterministically.
Augment string extraction:
Parse backticked paths and “created at …” patterns from Claude’s JSON result.
Resolve and include existing paths into files_modified.
Validation tuning
Per-task-type thresholds:
Documentation/summarize: lower similarity threshold or disable LLAMA similarity.
Treat “success && files_modified == [] && task_type in {fix, analyze}” as “no_effect_success” and surface a warning or soft-fail to encourage a retry with clearer instructions.
Record a short “effect summary” in artifacts: created X files, modified Y files.
Turn/time caps
Set a default CLAUDE_MAX_TURNS for doc/feature (e.g., 25–40) to bound latency.
Keep unlimited for long refactors only when explicitly requested.
Telemetry polish
Capture our own token-ish proxy if needed (prompt/output char counts) instead of relying on Claude’s usage.
Add event when any file is created/modified (“files_changed” with list).
Concrete edits to implement next
Use prompt templates:
Wire LlamaMediator.create_claude_prompt to load from prompts/agents/*.md per type and insert the “identify files then edit” block when target_files is empty.
Filesystem diff:
In ClaudeBridge.execute_task: take a timestamp and a quick snapshot of files under config.claude.allowed_root before/after; compute created/modified list and set TaskResult.files_modified.
Validation per type:
In ValidationEngine, branch thresholds by task type; add “no_effect_success” flag if fix/analyze had no changes.
Small parser add:
Add “documentation/doc/write docs” to the action verb list (maps to fix).
Optional UX cue:
Ask Claude to always output a short changelog section like:
“Created: path”, “Modified: path”
Keep our filesystem diff as the source of truth regardless.
Verdict
Yes, it is working; it created the doc from a very minimal instruction. The gaps are intent biasing, write attribution, and validation signals. The above small, surgical changes will make headless Telegram commands behave like a capable CLI assistant without you specifying files.
