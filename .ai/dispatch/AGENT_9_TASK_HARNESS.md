# AGENT 9 — Task Harness Workflow Kernel (v1)

**Dispatch created:** 2026-07-03
**Author:** adversarial pass over `docs/Task_harness_workflow.md` v0.4 → v0.5
(review: `.ai/dispatch/AGENT_9_TASK_HARNESS_REVIEW.md`)
**Branch to cut:** `feat/task-harness` off `main`
**Theme:** Stand up the v0.5 task-quality loop as **prompt-and-artifact
discipline** — templates, generators, and the Dispatch Pipeline — with **zero new
gateway state**. This is authoring + light tooling, not a workflow engine.

> **Test cost guard (READ FIRST).** Normal test command is plain `pytest`.
> Tests/flow must NOT invoke the paid Claude/Codex CLI. Never run the full e2e
> suite "to verify." Never run `python main.py status` (kills the live PM2
> gateway). Check a running gateway with `curl http://127.0.0.1:9003/health`.
> Real e2e is OpenCode-only (`AI_TEAM_ALLOW_OPENCODE_E2E=1 pytest --run-e2e`).

> **Read before editing:** `docs/Task_harness_workflow.md` (v0.5 — the spec you
> are implementing), this review's sibling `AGENT_9_TASK_HARNESS_REVIEW.md`, the
> reference dispatch `AGENT_8_OPERATOR_SIGNAL.md` (+ its `_REVIEW.md`) for the
> house F-tag/scope-guard/implementation-log style, `src/services/task_parser.py`
> and `src/services/file_watcher.py` (the `.task.md` auto-pickup primitive),
> `src/orchestrator.py::load_compact_context` (~:1661) and `_handle_new_task_file`
> (~:1673), and `.ai/CONTEXT.md` / `.ai/NEXT_TASKS.md`.

## The decision you are building against (do not relitigate)

v0.5 §0 locks it: **v1 adds ZERO new gateway state.** No `flow_runs` table, no
stage machine, no orchestrator changes to carry flow state. The XML task packet +
milestone file + the dispatch convention ARE the *workflow-orchestration* state. If
you feel the urge to add a migration or a `current_stage` column, STOP — that is
Phase 2 (§16) and is explicitly out of scope. The whole point of this dispatch is
that it is cheap and un-platformy.

> **CLARIFICATION — this does NOT sideline the database. Two different "states":**
> 1. **Conversation / task / artifact state stays DB-canonical** (`mesh_tasks`
>    ledger, migration 17 — spec §7). The harness's resume memory is
>    `load_compact_context(task_id)`, which reads *from the DB*. Nothing here
>    competes with or bypasses the DB system of record.
> 2. **Workflow-orchestration state** (`flow_run_id`, `current_stage`,
>    `plan_review`, a stage machine) is **not built at all in v1** — not "in files
>    instead of the DB," just *deferred* (§16), because the task model is
>    single-turn and the discipline hasn't yet proven it needs a flow engine.
>
> The `docs/harness/` files are **templates + prompt artifacts** (authoring
> material), NOT a state store. A milestone `.md` is a per-task scratchpad, not the
> system of record. So: DB = truth for work; files = the reusable *loop discipline*.

## Why these deliverables, in this order

Ranked so each rung is usable on its own and nothing depends on unbuilt gateway
state.

### T1 — Templates + Level rubric (LOW risk — ship first)

The loop is only as good as its artifacts. Produce the canonical, reusable files
the rest of the pipeline fills in. These are docs/templates, not code — safe,
immediately useful, and the substrate T2/T3 generate into.

### T2 — Generators (the DRAFT / REVIEW / CLOSE roles) (MEDIUM — ship second)

The prompts/skills that turn intent → packet, run the adversarial review → F-tags,
and produce the closure summary. These encode §14's pipeline steps 1–3 and 6–7.

### T3 — Dispatch Pipeline wiring + auto-pickup guard (MEDIUM — ship last)

Wire the end-to-end handoff onto the **existing** `.task.md` auto-pickup primitive,
and enforce the safety boundary: **Level 3 requires operator approval before
dispatch; auto-enqueue is allowed only for Level ≤ 2.**

---

## Execution plan

### T1 — Templates + Level rubric

Create under `docs/harness/` (new dir) — pure authoring, no code:

1. `packet_template.xml` — the §2.1 XML Task Packet skeleton with inline
   `<!-- guidance -->` comments per field (what "objective_lock" vs
   "literal_request" mean; how to phrase non-goals/drift-risks).
2. `milestone_template.md` — the §2.2 burndown file (Objective / Current Status /
   Burndown / Live Log / Blockers / Next Action). State the update rule at top:
   *"Executor updates this after every meaningful step; on resume this file +
   `load_compact_context(task_id)` is ground truth, not model memory."*
3. `level_rubric.md` — the §3 level selector as a short decision checklist. Lead
   with the **Level-3 triggers** (DB migration; security/secrets; mesh/worker;
   trading; agent-behavior/autonomy; destructive op; > ~5 files / service
   boundary) and "when in doubt, escalate one level." Include the **cost cap**
   (review off for Level ≤ 1; plan↔review loop ≤ 2 rounds).
4. `README.md` for `docs/harness/` — one screen: what the harness is, the level
   ladder, which template to use when, and a pointer to the spec.

   > **[F1] Do NOT add gateway state.** These are files. No migration, no
   > orchestrator edit, no `flow_runs`. If a template references "state," it means
   > the milestone file + `mesh_tasks` ledger that already exist.

**Verify:** the four files render; a human can pick a level and fill a packet from
them with no other context. No tests needed (docs). `git add` under `docs/harness/`.

### T2 — Generators (DRAFT / REVIEW / CLOSE)

Implement as **prompt artifacts / skills**, not services. Prefer authoring them as
reusable prompt docs under `docs/harness/generators/` (and, if a skill is the
right home, a thin skill that loads them). Each is a role from §4.

1. `draft_packet.md` — the DRAFT prompt ("text engine" role, §14 step 1): input =
   intent + curated `<context_snippets>` (§8) + level; output = a filled
   `packet_template.xml` + an initialized milestone file. It must curate snippets
   (small, source-tagged, relevance stated), never dump raw context.
   > **[F2] Memory = existing systems.** The DRAFT prompt pulls resume context from
   > `load_compact_context(task_id)` and file-memory (`MEMORY.md`), NOT a new
   > store. `<memory_entry>` (§7) is a file-memory *write format* only. Do not
   > build a memory service or an async-compression job.
2. `adversarial_review.md` — the REVIEW prompt (§14 step 2): challenge assumptions,
   find P0/P1, emit **F-tagged findings** in the house style (stable `[Fn]`,
   one-line defect, concrete failure scenario). Output feeds the inline FIX loop
   (step 3), **capped at 2 rounds** (§3 cost cap); unresolved items become explicit
   non-goals or logged risks — never silently dropped.
   > **[F3] Onboarding smoke is NOT here.** The provider/model smoke (§9) is
   > provider-onboarding only and cost-guarded — do NOT put a model smoke in the
   > per-task review prompt. Implementation review uses `/code-review` +
   > `/security-review` on the committed diff (§5), which cost nothing extra.
3. `closure_summary.md` — the CLOSE prompt (§14 step 7): what changed, what
   follows, F-tag outcomes (`fixed`/`accepted`/`no change needed`), and the
   `.ai/CONTEXT.md` / `.ai/NEXT_TASKS.md` update stub. Level-3 wiki is OPTIONAL and
   never a gate.
   > **[F6] No parser, no gate.** The XML packet is model-facing prose — do NOT
   > write a validator/parser for it. The wiki is optional; Markdown is source of
   > truth; closure never blocks on it.

**Verify:** dry-run each generator by hand on one real small task from
`.ai/NEXT_TASKS.md` (e.g. a doc tweak) end-to-end: DRAFT → a packet + milestone,
REVIEW → at least one plausible F-tag, CLOSE → a summary. No paid CLI. If any
generator is backed by a skill file, `--collect-only`/import-smoke it; do not
execute a paid backend.

### T3 — Dispatch Pipeline wiring + auto-pickup guard

Wire §14 onto the **existing** primitive; add the safety boundary. Minimal code,
only where a doc can't enforce behavior.

**Read:** `src/services/task_parser.py` (`.task.md` YAML-frontmatter format),
`src/services/file_watcher.py`, `orchestrator.py::_handle_new_task_file`.

1. `docs/harness/dispatch_pipeline.md` — the §14 runbook: DRAFT → REVIEW → FIX →
   DISPATCH (`.ai/dispatch/<NAME>.md` + optional `.task.md`) → EXECUTE (burndown +
   milestone + checkpoint commits) → CHECKPOINT review (§5) → CLOSE. Reference the
   auto-pickup path by file:function.
2. **Auto-pickup safety guard.** Confirm in code exactly where a `.task.md` becomes
   an enqueued task, then enforce: **auto-enqueue only for Level ≤ 2; Level 3
   requires the operator-approval stage first.** Prefer a *convention* (a required
   `harness_level` field in the `.task.md` frontmatter + a documented rule the
   dispatch prompt obeys). Only if a convention can't hold it, add a **minimal,
   flag-guarded** check in the pickup path that refuses to auto-enqueue a
   `harness_level: 3` file without an explicit `approved: true` field — smallest
   possible change, off by default, no behavior change when the field is absent.
   > **[F4] Sequential, not concurrent.** The checkpoint reviewer runs AFTER an
   > executor commit, against the committed diff — do NOT design a live tailer or
   > two agents on one working tree.
   > **[F5] Level is deterministic.** The pipeline selects level via
   > `level_rubric.md` triggers, not vibes; "when in doubt, escalate."
   > **[F1-again] No new gateway state.** If step 2 needs code, it is a *guard* in
   > the existing pickup path, not a flow table. Keep it under a feature flag so
   > `MESH_ENABLED`/default behavior is byte-identical when the field is absent.
3. Update `docs/Task_harness_workflow.md` §13 checklist to tick what shipped, and
   add a short "how to run the harness" pointer to `.ai/CONTEXT.md`.

**Verify:** if you added a pickup guard, a `pytest` unit test: a `harness_level: 3`
`.task.md` without `approved: true` is NOT auto-enqueued; a Level-2 file is; absent
field ⇒ unchanged legacy behavior. If it stayed convention-only, state that
plainly and show the doc rule. `curl http://127.0.0.1:9003/health` if a gateway is
up — do not restart it.

---

## Sequencing & guardrails

- Land T1 → T2 → T3 as separate commits/PRs on `feat/task-harness`. T1 is pure
  docs; T2 is prompt artifacts; T3 is docs + at most one tiny flag-guarded guard.
- **No new gateway state, no migration, no stage machine** (that is Phase 2, §16).
- No paid CLI in any stage. No memory service. No packet parser/validator. No live
  tailing reviewer. Wiki stays optional and un-automated.
- Every rung ends green: `pytest` targeted (only if you added code), and each doc
  is self-sufficient for a fresh agent.
- Auto-pickup of **Level 3** work is forbidden without operator approval.

---

## Definition of done

1. `docs/harness/` holds the four T1 files + T2 generators + T3 pipeline runbook.
2. A fresh executor can, from `dispatch_pipeline.md` alone, run intent → packet →
   review → dispatch → execute → checkpoint → close on a real small task.
3. The Level-3 auto-pickup guard holds (test if code; documented rule if
   convention).
4. `docs/Task_harness_workflow.md` §13 ticked; `.ai/CONTEXT.md` +
   `.ai/NEXT_TASKS.md` updated with a harness pointer and this dispatch's outcome.
5. Zero new gateway state; zero paid-CLI calls; default gateway behavior unchanged.
